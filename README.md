**README: Medicare Healthcare Data Analysis**

**Overview**

This project presents a midterm assignment focused on analyzing healthcare data using Python and common data science libraries. The work is compiled and exported as an HTML report from a Jupyter Notebook.

**Objective**

The goal of the analysis is to extract meaningful insights from healthcare-related datasets, applying data wrangling, visualization, and statistical methods to better understand patient trends, clinical operations, or treatment outcomes.

**Tools & Technologies**

Python 3

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas – for data manipulation

Matplotlib / Seaborn – for visualization

NumPy – for numerical operations

Scikit-learn / Statsmodels (if used) – for basic modeling or regression analysis

**Features**

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Visual representation of trends and relationships

Interpretations and conclusions from the analysis

**Output**

The final output is a standalone HTML report generated from a Jupyter Notebook, suitable for review, grading, or sharing with non-technical stakeholders.
